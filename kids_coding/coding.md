# Ok so really, what is programming?

---

## Programming is the act of writing **programs**

---

### A **program** is a set of instructions I give to a computer. It will do something specific, like solve a puzzle or do a task. 

---

# Programs are written in code

### Code is like English, but is very specific with its instructions

---

# Let's Make a Sandwitch

---

# Code can't be misinterpreted

* A program will run the exact same way every time
* Computers are dumb - they do exactly what you tell them to do
* If you tell them to do the wrong thing, they will do the wrong thing

---

# Can you name any programs?

---

# What might a program do?

* Show a web page
* Do some math
* solve a sudoku
* Play a song 

---

# Some programs I've written recently
* Count the words in an e-book
* track some tasks
* split students into groups
* count the days until an event

---

# This is a (simple) program

<br>

```js
console.log('Hello, World!')

console.log(2 + 2)

console.log('2' + '2')
```

<br>

What do you think will happen?

---

```js
console.log('Hello, World!')
```

---

```js
console.log('Hello, World!')
> Hello, World!
```

---

```js
console.log('Hello, World!')
> Hello, World!

console.log(2 + 2)
```

---

```js
console.log('Hello, World!')
> Hello, World!

console.log(2 + 2)
> 4
```

---

```js
console.log('Hello, World!')
> Hello, World!

console.log(2 + 2)
> 4
 
console.log('2' + '2')
```

---

```js
console.log('Hello, World!')
> Hello, World!

console.log(2 + 2)
> 4
 
console.log('2' + '2')
> 22
```

# A Few Questions, Answered

---

## How do I start a project?

When I start, I do it without code. I think about the problem I'm trying to solve and how I would do it by hand. 

The computer doesn't know how to solve your problem, you have to tell it how

---

## How long does a project take?

It really depends! Some programs are written to solve simple tasks and are done in 3 minutes. Others are large projects that take months of work

---

## When did I get into programming?

I've been interested in computers my whole life and started thinking about them seriously in high school, when I took the AP computer science class. I've been programming ever since!

---

# What does the future hold?

If only I knew!

I think big picture, more and more jobs that are done by humans today will be done by computers in the near future. Things like driving a car and ordering food at a restaurant.
